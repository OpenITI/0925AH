90#VERS#COMMENT##: OCRed through Kraken:
    * segmentation model: DEFAULT
    * OCR model: arabPers-WithDiffTypefaces.mlmodel.
    Pagination is -1. This appears to be a different kind of text,
    so I am not sure if there are many canons here.
    It seems to contain legal classifications(e.g., purity > wudu', etc.)
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
