90#VERS#COMMENT##: Poetry tagged. The pdf is another print (unknown which one)
    of the same edition used for the digital text (the seventh Bulaq printing). The
    worldcat link is also not for this seventh edition, but an earlier one. As a
    result, the pagination is different or simply missing in most places where there
    is simply PageV00P000 (almost 4000 instances) . Because of this and because of
    the difficult to follow layout of the pdf, I have annotated based on textual
    logic. Structure was pre-tagged but needed significant cleaning up. I have done
    this but may have missed some parts due to the huge size of the work.
    Fortunately the organisation is very clear in general: first level for books,
    second level for bab, third level for individual numbered hadith with a rare
    fourth level for tanbih and similar glosses. This division is fine across the
    majority of the work except in book 66 which introduces another layer of Quran
    verses, which I have designated as second level, same as bab chapters. This
    chapter probably needs revision. There seem to be some redundant parts with
    repeated sections, see for example book 70, the beginning of bab 12 is included
    twice. In book 42 the title of bab 1 is also repeated. There are more such
    instances.
    NB: check lines of poetry that seem too short: line numbers 168983, 213927
   NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): I found the PDF of the same edition and replaced the link. So the page numbers are the same. However, there is still difference between the PDF and the digital version. This is because at the beginning of the headers, there is a paragraph added by the typist quoting just the original hadith (i.e. just the parts that are in parenthesis in the PDF), and then the original text begins. 2- It is possible that parts of some headers are entered into the body text or vice versa. Regarding the huge length of the text, I didn’t check all the headers. A careful reading is needed to make sure about this. There shouldn’t be many cases as far as my random check can suggests. 3- The typist has added headers for most baabs although they already have headers in the text. So, some of the headers are repeated in their following line. However, I didn’t delete such cases since there is a little difference between the typist’s headers and the text’s headers, and the typist’s headers are actually clearer and more usable. 4- In book 65 which is mentioned by the annotator, I added another level of levelling. 5- Find other editions of the text: https://ketabpedia.com/%D8%AA%D8%AD%D9%85%D9%8A%D9%84/%D8%A5%D8%B1%D8%B4%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A-%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%B1%D8%AD-%D8%B5%D8%AD%D9%8A%D8%AD-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%AE%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A-%D8%B7-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%85%D9%8A/; https://archive.org/details/rain_bow2020_yahoo_20170920_1105; and a manuscript here: https://archive.org/details/mscodex1951
